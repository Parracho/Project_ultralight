  abstract = {An exact relativistic single-integral formula for the thermal average of the annihilation cross section times velocity, the key quantity in the determination of the cosmic relic abundance of a species, is obtained. Since it does not require expansion of the cross section at low relative velocity, it can also be used when the cross section varies rapidly with energy, e.g. near the formation of a resonance or the opening of a new annihilation channel. We discuss approximate formulas in these cases, and we find that dips in the relic density near resonances are significantly broader and shallower than previously thought and that spurious reductions near thresholds disappear.},

abstract = {The Cuba library provides new implementations of four general-purpose multidimensional integration algorithms: Vegas, Suave, Divonne, and Cuhre. Suave is a new algorithm, Divonne is a known algorithm to which important details have been added, and Vegas and Cuhre are new implementations of existing algorithms with only few improvements over the original versions. All four algorithms can integrate vector integrands and have very similar Fortran, C/C++, and Mathematica interfaces.

It is assumed that these systems were produced by hierarchical clustering and were endowed with their angular momenta by tidal torques. In order to test the theory, we have developed some models that determine the structure of the haloes in terms of the observable properties of the discs. A comparison of the models with a sample of 25 galaxies leads to the following conclusions: (1) Collapse factors of 10 or more and halo-to-disc mass ratios of five or more are required to explain the rapid rotation of the discs. (2) The halo rotation curves, computed on the assumption of detailed conservation of angular momentum in the discs, are fairly fiat. (3) Most discs are globally unstable to the formation of non-axisymmetric perturbations unless their mass-to-light ratios are significantly smaller than current estimates. (4) There is a tentative indication that the mass and luminosity distributions in the bulge regions of galaxies are not closely related. (5) The parts of galactic discs that are unstable to fragmentation at 104 K correspond well with the parts that are optically visible; smaller discs would be completely stabilized by rotation.}",
