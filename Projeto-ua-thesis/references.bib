  abstract = {An exact relativistic single-integral formula for the thermal average of the annihilation cross section times velocity, the key quantity in the determination of the cosmic relic abundance of a species, is obtained. Since it does not require expansion of the cross section at low relative velocity, it can also be used when the cross section varies rapidly with energy, e.g. near the formation of a resonance or the opening of a new annihilation channel. We discuss approximate formulas in these cases, and we find that dips in the relic density near resonances are significantly broader and shallower than previously thought and that spurious reductions near thresholds disappear.},

abstract = {The Cuba library provides new implementations of four general-purpose multidimensional integration algorithms: Vegas, Suave, Divonne, and Cuhre. Suave is a new algorithm, Divonne is a known algorithm to which important details have been added, and Vegas and Cuhre are new implementations of existing algorithms with only few improvements over the original versions. All four algorithms can integrate vector integrands and have very similar Fortran, C/C++, and Mathematica interfaces.
