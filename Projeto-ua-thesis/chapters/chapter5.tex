\label{chapter:conclusion}

In this work we took a look at an extension of the SM that allows a pGB to emerge in the physical basis, and then a brief review of the thermodynamics of the primordial universe. We were able to conclude that for a mixing angle, $\alpha\lesssim 10^{-7}$ our dark matter candidate doesn't couple with the thermal bath and therefore doesn't become relativistic. We also confirmed that any scenario where $h_2$ is heavier, equal or lighter, than the SM-Higgs, is valid.
We were also able to use the misalignment mechanism in order to find the relic density of this candidate, and say that for a value of $v_\sigma$ in the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{18})$ its a viable option for a DM candidate.
The culmination of this work allows us to see that the pNGB is a viable candidate for DM .
